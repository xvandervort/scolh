  Payments have four terms: Who pays, who to, how much and when. Long run: how much and when could be dependent on some other things like delivery schedules, milestones. So, let's see how hard it would be to accomodate that. A payment schedule would be made up of sub payments, each with all of the above terms. BUT, instead of dollar amounts, it could be a percentage of something else.
    So a payment schedule comes later, as do percents. Right now we just go with the 4 major terms.
    Now, how do we express the "who" involved?
      This means I need to do 3 things: List parties. Add an alias to a party ("Joe's Bar and Grill, henceforth referred to as JBG") or list parties by number.
      But for now, let's just do it by name. KISS.

  Project begins. It is only going to be proof of concept quality (meaning low quality, low functionality). This piece provides a human-ish language for specifying simple contract terms. This will in turn generate a config file that can be read into code that will generate finished and workable contract code. 

  Why go to so much trouble? Because humans shouldn't have to know how to code to be able to do ordinary business. Lawyers and judges shouldn't need to learn to code AND the law. Accountants and business folk shouldn't have to learn to code AND accounting and business regulations and such. This should all be easy!

  It is now possible to add parties to the contract (but not their contact or identifying information). 
  NEXT: Add payment amounts?
